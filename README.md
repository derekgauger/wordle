# wordle
A repo with a Wordle solver and Wordle game coded in Python

These are text-based Python programs for simulating and solving Wordle problems. I created these as a fun little project
to kind of challenge myself while I was bored. The Wordle solver was tested a lot more than the Wordle game. If
whoever is reading this decides to download the game file and finds a bug feel free to tell me about it.
